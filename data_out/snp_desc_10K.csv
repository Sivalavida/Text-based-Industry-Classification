AAL,0000004515,PART I   ITEM 1. BUSINESS  Overview  American Airlines Group Inc. (AAG)  a Delaware corporation  is a holding company and its principal  wholly-owned subsidiaries are American Airlines  Inc. (American)  Envoy Aviation Group Inc. (Envoy)  PSA Airlines  Inc. (PSA) and Piedmont Airlines  Inc. (Piedmont). AAG was formed in 1982 under the name AMR Corporation (AMR) as the parent company of American  which was founded in 1934.   AAG’s and American’s principal executive offices are located at 1 Skyview Drive  Fort Worth  Texas 76155 and their telephone number is 817-963-1234.  Airline Operations  Our primary business activity is the operation of a major network carrier  providing scheduled air transportation for passengers and cargo.  Together with our wholly-owned regional airline subsidiaries and third-party regional carriers operating as American Eagle  our airline operates an average of 6 800 flights per day to more than 365 destinations in 61 countries through our hubs and gateways in Charlotte  Chicago  Dallas/Fort Worth  London Heathrow  Los Angeles  Miami  New York  Philadelphia  Phoenix and Washington  D.C. In 2019  approximately 215 million passengers boarded our flights. During 2019  we launched new seasonal nonstop service to transatlantic markets Dubrovnik  Croatia and Berlin  Germany from Philadelphia International Airport (PHL). We also announced an international expansion beginning in summer 2020 that will  among other things  introduce new seasonal nonstop service between PHL and Casablanca  Morocco  representing our entry into the African market  new seasonal nonstop service between Chicago O’Hare International Airport (ORD) and Krakow  Poland  Prague  Czech Republic and Budapest  Hungary  and the return of service to Tel Aviv  Israel  with year-round nonstop service from Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (DFW). Beginning in October 2020  we also plan to operate new seasonal nonstop service between Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) and Christchurch  New Zealand and from DFW to Auckland  New Zealand  to which we currently operate seasonal service from LAX.   As of December 31  2019  we operated 942 mainline aircraft supported by our regional airline subsidiaries and third-party regional carriers  which operated an additional 605 regional aircraft. See Part I  Item 2. Properties for further discussion on our mainline and regional aircraft and “Regional” below for further discussion on our regional operations.  American is a founding member of the oneworld® alliance  whose members serve 1 100 destinations in 180 countries and territories. See below for further discussion on the oneworld alliance and other agreements with domestic and international airlines.  See Part II  Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations –“2019 Financial Overview ” “AAG’s Results of Operations” and “American’s Results of Operations” for further discussion of AAG’s and American’s operating results and operating performance. Also  see Note 14 to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II  Item 8A and Note 12 to American’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II  Item 8B for information regarding operating segments and see Note 1(k) to each of AAG’s and American’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II  Items 8A and 8B  respectively  for passenger revenue by geographic region.   Regional  Our regional carriers provide scheduled air transportation under the brand name “American Eagle.” The American Eagle carriers include our wholly-owned regional carriers Envoy  PSA and Piedmont  as well as third-party regional carriers including Republic Airline Inc. (Republic)  Mesa Airlines  Inc. (Mesa)  SkyWest Airlines  Inc. (SkyWest) and Compass Airlines  LLC (Compass). Our regional carriers are an integral component of our operating network. We rely heavily on regional carriers to drive feeder traffic to our hubs from low-density markets that are not economical for us to serve with larger  mainline aircraft. In addition  regional carriers offer complementary service in many of our mainline markets. During 2019  approximately 59 million passengers boarded our regional carriers’ planes  approximately 43% of whom connected to or from our mainline flights. All American Eagle carriers use logos  service marks  aircraft paint schemes and uniforms similar to those of our mainline operations.  5  Substantially all of our regional carrier arrangements are in the form of capacity purchase agreements. The capacity purchase agreements provide that all revenues  including passenger  in-flight  ancillary  mail and freight revenues  go to us. We control marketing  scheduling  ticketing  pricing and seat inventories. In return  we agree to pay predetermined fees to these airlines for operating an agreed-upon number of aircraft  without regard to the number of passengers on board. In addition  these agreements provide that we either reimburse or pay 100% of certain variable costs  such as airport landing fees  fuel and passenger liability insurance.   Cargo  Our cargo division provides a wide range of freight and mail services  with facilities and interline connections available across the globe.  Distribution and Marketing Agreements  Passengers can purchase tickets for travel on American through several distribution channels  including our website (www.aa.com)  our mobile app  our reservations centers and third-party distribution channels  including those provided by or through global distribution systems (e.g.  Amadeus  Sabre and Travelport)  conventional travel agents  travel management companies and online travel agents (e.g.  Expedia  including its booking sites Orbitz and Travelocity  and Booking Holdings  including its booking sites Kayak and Priceline). To remain competitive  we will need to manage our distribution costs and rights effectively  increase our distribution flexibility and improve the functionality of our proprietary and third-party distribution channels  while maintaining an industry-competitive cost structure. For more discussion  see Part I  Item 1A. Risk Factors – “We rely on third-party distribution channels and must manage effectively the costs  rights and functionality of these channels.”  In general  beyond nonstop city pairs  carriers that have the greatest ability to seamlessly connect passengers to and from markets have a competitive advantage. In some cases  however  foreign governments limit U.S. air carriers’ rights to transport passengers beyond designated gateway cities in foreign countries. In order to improve access to domestic and foreign markets  we have arrangements with other airlines including through the oneworld alliance  other cooperation agreements  joint business agreements (JBAs)  and marketing relationships  as further discussed below.  Member of oneworld Alliance  American is a founding member of the oneworld alliance  which currently includes British Airways  Cathay Pacific Airways  Finnair  Iberia  Japan Airlines  LATAM Airlines Group  Malaysia Airlines  Qantas Airways  Qatar Airways  Royal Jordanian  S7 Airlines and SriLankan Airlines. The oneworld alliance links the networks of the member carriers and their respective affiliates to enhance customer service and smooth connections to the destinations served by the alliance  including linking the carriers’ loyalty programs and access to the carriers’ airport lounge facilities. Royal Air Maroc is expected to join the oneworld alliance in 2020. LATAM Airlines Group (LATAM) is in the process of withdrawing from the oneworld alliance  which is anticipated to be completed in the first half of 2020.   Cooperation and Joint Business Agreements  American has established a transatlantic JBA with British Airways  Iberia and Finnair  a transpacific JBA with Japan Airlines and a JBA relating to Australia and New Zealand with Qantas Airways  each of which has been granted antitrust immunity. Joint business agreements enable the carriers party to the relevant agreement to cooperate on flights between particular destinations and allow pooling and sharing of certain revenues and costs  enhanced loyalty program reciprocity and cooperation in other areas. American and its joint business partners received regulatory approval to enter into these JBAs and cooperation agreements. Joint business agreements have become a common approach among major carriers to address key regulatory restrictions typically applicable to international airline service  including limitations on the foreign ownership of airlines and national laws prohibiting foreign airlines from carrying passengers beyond specific gateway cities. Our competitors  including Delta Air Lines and United Airlines  are party to similar arrangements.  The business relationship under the transatlantic JBA benefits from a grant of antitrust immunity from the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) and was reviewed by the European Commission (EC) in July 2010. In connection with this review  we provided certain commitments to the EC regarding  among other things  the availability of take-off and landing slots at London Heathrow (LHR) or London Gatwick (LGW) airports. The commitments accepted by the EC are binding for 10 years. In October 2018  in anticipation of the exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union (EU)  commonly referred to as Brexit  and the expiry of the EC commitments in July 2020  the United Kingdom Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) opened an investigation into the transatlantic JBA. We continue to fully cooperate with the CMA. An application for antitrust immunity is also pending with the DOT to add Aer Lingus  which is owned by the parent company of British Airways and Iberia  to the transatlantic JBA.   6  As announced in September 2019  we are in the process of unwinding our commercial relationship with LATAM. We do not expect this change to have a significant financial impact on our company. After giving effect to this change  American remains the largest U.S. carrier to Latin America.  Marketing Relationships  To improve access to each other’s markets  various U.S. and foreign air carriers  including American  have established marketing agreements with other airlines. These marketing agreements generally provide enhanced customer choice by means of an expanded network with reciprocal loyalty program participation and joint sales cooperation. As of December 31  2019  American had codeshare and/or loyalty program relationships with Air Tahiti Nui  Alaska Airlines  British Airways  Cape Air  Cathay Dragon  Cathay Pacific  China Southern Airlines  EL AL  Etihad Airways  Fiji Airways  Finnair  Gulf Air  Hawaiian Airlines  Iberia  Interjet  Japan Airlines  Jetstar Group (includes Jetstar Airways and Jetstar Japan)  Korean Air  LATAM (includes LATAM Airlines  LATAM Argentina  LATAM Brasil  LATAM Peru  LATAM Colombia and LATAM Ecuador)  Malaysia Airlines  Qantas Airways  Qatar Airways  Royal Air Maroc  Royal Jordanian  S7 Airlines  Seaborne Airlines  SriLankan Airlines and Vueling Airlines. In February 2020  American announced that it intends to enter into a codeshare relationship with the Brazilian airline  GOL Linhas Aéreas  which is expected to be implemented in 2020  subject to the receipt of relevant government approvals.   Recent Developments  On February 13  2020  we announced our intention to enter into an expanded relationship with Alaska Airlines. This arrangement  once finalized  will expand our existing codeshare relationship  including codeshare on certain of our international routes from Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (SEA) and LAX  and will provide for reciprocal loyalty program benefits and shared lounge access. In addition  we announced new nonstop international service from SEA to Bangalore  India and to LHR  expected to commence in October 2020 and March 2021  respectively. The implementation of this expanded relationship and commencement of these new routes are subject to the negotiation and execution of definitive documentation and governmental review.  Loyalty Program  Our loyalty program  AAdvantage®  was established to develop passenger loyalty by offering awards to travelers for their continued patronage. AAdvantage was named Best Elite Program in the Americas for the eighth consecutive year in that category at the 2019 Freddie Awards  which are annual awards that recognize the world’s most outstanding frequent travel programs. AAdvantage members earn mileage credits by flying on American  any oneworld airline or other partner airlines  or by using the services of over 1 000 program participants  such as the Citi and Barclaycard US co-branded credit cards  and certain hotels and car rental companies. For every dollar spent  non-status members earn five mileage credits  but Gold  Platinum  Platinum Pro and Executive Platinum status holders earn bonus mileage credits of seven  eight  nine and eleven mileage credits  respectively.  All travel on eligible tickets counts toward qualification for elite status in the AAdvantage program. Mileage credits can be redeemed for free or upgraded travel on American and participating airlines  membership to our Admirals Club® or for other non-travel awards from our program participants. Most travel awards are subject to capacity-controlled seating. A member’s mileage credit does not expire as long as that member has any type of qualifying activity at least once every 18 months. Elite members can enjoy additional benefits of the AAdvantage program  including complimentary upgrades  checked bags  and Preferred and Main Cabin Extra seats  as well as priority check-in  security  boarding and baggage delivery. Additionally  our members earn bonus mileage credits when elite status is obtained.   Under our agreements with AAdvantage members and program partners  we reserve the right to change the terms of the AAdvantage program at any time and without notice  and may end the program with six months’ notice. Program rules  partners  special offers  awards and requisite mileage levels for awards are subject to change.  During 2019  our members redeemed approximately 14 million awards  including travel redemptions for flights and upgrades on American and other air carriers  as well as redemption of car and hotel awards  club memberships and merchandise. Approximately 8% of our 2019 total revenue passenger miles flown were from award travel.  See Part II  Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” for more information on our loyalty program.  7  Industry Competition  Domestic  The markets in which we operate are highly competitive. On most of our domestic nonstop routes  we currently face competing service from other domestic airlines  including major network airlines  low-cost carriers and ultra-low-cost carriers such as Alaska Airlines  Allegiant Air  Delta Air Lines  Frontier Airlines  Hawaiian Airlines  JetBlue Airways  Southwest Airlines  Spirit Airlines and United Airlines. Competition is even greater between cities that require a connection  where the major airlines compete via their respective hubs. In addition  we face competition on some of our connecting routes from airlines operating point-to-point service on such routes. We also compete with all-cargo and charter airlines and  particularly on shorter segments  ground and rail transportation.  On all of our routes  pricing decisions are affected  in large part  by the need to meet competition from other airlines. Price competition occurs on a market-by-market basis through price discounts  changes in pricing structures  fare matching  targeted promotions and loyalty program initiatives. Airlines typically use discounted fares and other promotions to stimulate traffic during normally slack travel periods  when they begin service to new cities or when they have excess capacity  to generate cash flow  to maximize revenue per available seat mile and to establish  increase or preserve market share. Most airlines will quickly match price reductions in a particular market  and we have often elected to match discounted or promotional fares initiated by other air carriers in certain markets in order to compete in those markets. In addition  low-fare  low-cost carriers  such as Southwest Airlines and JetBlue Airways  and so-called ultra-low-cost carriers  such as Allegiant Air  Frontier Airlines and Spirit Airlines  compete in many of the markets in which we operate and competition from these carriers is increasing.  In addition to price competition  airlines compete for market share by increasing the size of their route system and the number of markets they serve. The American Eagle regional carriers increase the number of markets we serve by flying to lower demand markets and providing connections at our hubs. Many of our competitors also own or have agreements with regional airlines that provide similar services at their hubs and other locations. We also compete on the basis of scheduling (frequency and flight times)  availability of nonstop flights  on-time performance  type of equipment  cabin configuration  amenities provided to passengers  loyalty programs  the automation of travel agent reservation systems  onboard products and other services.   International  In addition to our extensive domestic service  we provide international service to Canada  Mexico  the Caribbean  Central and South America  Asia  Europe  Australia and New Zealand  and in 2020  will expand our international service to include Israel as well as Morocco  our first African destination. In providing international air transportation  we compete with other U.S. airlines  foreign investor-owned airlines and foreign state-owned or state-affiliated airlines. Competition is increasing from foreign state-owned and state-affiliated airlines in the Gulf region  including Emirates  Etihad Airways and Qatar Airways. These carriers have large numbers of international widebody aircraft in service and on order and are increasing service to the U.S. from locations both in and outside the Middle East. Service to and from locations outside of the Middle East is provided by some of these carriers under so-called “fifth freedom” rights permitted under international treaties which allow service to and from stopover points between an airline’s home country and the ultimate destination. Such flights  such as a stopover in Europe on flights to the United States  allow the carrier to sell tickets for travel between the stopover point and the United States in competition with service provided by us. We believe these state-owned and state-affiliated carriers in the Gulf region  including their affiliated carriers  benefit from significant government subsidies  which have allowed them to grow quickly  reinvest in their product and expand their global presence. Competition is also increasing from low-cost airlines executing international long-haul expansion strategies.  In order to increase our ability to compete for international air transportation service  which is subject to extensive government regulation  U.S. and foreign carriers have entered into bilateral and multilateral marketing relationships  alliances  cooperation agreements and JBAs to exchange traffic among each other’s flights and route networks. See “Distribution and Marketing Agreements” above for further discussion.  8  Employees and Labor Relations  The airline business is labor intensive. In 2019  salaries  wages and benefits were our largest expense and represented 34% of our total operating expenses. As of December 31  2019  we had approximately 133 700 active full-time equivalent employees  approximately 85% of whom were represented by various labor unions responsible for negotiating the collective bargaining agreements (CBAs) covering them.  Labor relations in the air transportation industry are regulated under the Railway Labor Act (RLA)  which vests in the National Mediation Board (NMB) certain functions with respect to disputes between airlines and labor unions relating to union representation and CBAs. When an RLA CBA becomes amendable  if either party to the agreement wishes to modify its terms  it must notify the other party in the manner prescribed under the RLA and as agreed by the parties. Under the RLA  the parties must meet for direct negotiations  and  if no agreement is reached during direct negotiations between the parties  either party may request that the NMB appoint a federal mediator. The RLA prescribes no timetable for the direct negotiation and mediation processes  and it is not unusual for those processes to last for many months or even several years. If no agreement is reached in mediation  the NMB in its discretion may declare that an impasse exists and proffer binding arbitration to the parties. Either party may decline to submit to arbitration and if arbitration is rejected by either party  a 30-day “cooling off” period commences. During or after that period  a Presidential Emergency Board (PEB) may be established  which examines the parties’ positions and recommends a solution. The PEB process lasts for 30 days and is followed by another 30-day “cooling off” period. At the end of this “cooling off” period  unless an agreement is reached or action is taken by Congress  the labor organization may exercise “self-help ” such as a strike  and the airline may resort to its own “self-help ” including the imposition of any or all of its proposed amendments to the CBA and the hiring of new employees to replace any striking workers.  None of the unions representing our employees presently may lawfully engage in concerted slowdowns or refusals to work  such as strikes  sick-outs or other similar activity  against us. Nonetheless  there is a risk that employees  either with or without union involvement  could engage in one or more concerted refusals to work that could individually or collectively harm the operation of our airline and impair our financial performance.  The following table shows our domestic airline employee groups that are represented by unions:  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  9  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  (1) Approximate number of active employees represented as of December 31  2019.  Joint collective bargaining agreements (JCBAs) have been reached with post-Merger employee groups  except for contracts with the TWU-IAM Association which represents the mechanics and related  fleet service  stock clerks  maintenance control technicians and maintenance training instructors whose contracts became amendable in the third quarter of 2018. Agreements in principle were reached with the TWU-IAM Association on January 30  2020 for JCBAs covering all of these workgroups. Those agreements are subject to membership ratification vote. Additionally  the post-Merger JCBAs covering our pilots and flight attendants became amendable in January 2020 and December 2019  respectively. Negotiations continue for new agreements.  Among our wholly-owned regional subsidiaries  the Envoy fleet service clerks  Piedmont flight attendants and Piedmont dispatchers have agreements that are now amendable and are engaged in traditional RLA negotiations. Envoy is also in negotiations with the union representing its flight attendants  whose contract becomes amendable in 2020.  For more discussion  see Part I  Item 1A. Risk Factors – “Union disputes  employee strikes and other labor-related disruptions  or our inability to otherwise maintain labor costs at competitive levels may adversely affect our operations and financial performance.”  Aircraft Fuel  Our operations and financial results are significantly affected by the availability and price of aircraft fuel  which in 2019 was our second largest expense. Based on our 2020 forecasted mainline and regional fuel consumption  we estimate that a one cent per gallon increase in the price of aircraft fuel would increase our 2020 annual fuel expense by $47 million.  The following table shows annual aircraft fuel consumption and costs  including taxes  for our mainline and regional operations for 2019 and 2018 (gallons and aircraft fuel expense in millions).  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  10  As of December 31  2019  we did not have any fuel hedging contracts outstanding to hedge our fuel consumption. As such  and assuming we do not enter into any future transactions to hedge our fuel consumption  we will continue to be fully exposed to fluctuations in aircraft fuel prices. Our current policy is not to enter into transactions to hedge our fuel consumption  although we review that policy from time to time based on market conditions and other factors.  Aircraft fuel prices have in the past  and may in the future  experience substantial volatility. We cannot predict the future availability  price volatility or cost of aircraft fuel. Natural disasters (including hurricanes or similar events in the U.S. Southeast and on the Gulf Coast where a significant portion of domestic refining capacity is located)  political disruptions or wars involving oil-producing countries  economic sanctions imposed against oil-producing countries or specific industry participants  changes in fuel-related governmental policy  the strength of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies  changes in the cost to transport or store petroleum products  changes in access to petroleum product pipelines and terminals  speculation in the energy futures markets  changes in aircraft fuel production capacity or competing demand for fuel from other transport industries  such as maritime shipping  environmental concerns and other unpredictable events may result in fuel supply shortages  distribution challenges  additional fuel price volatility and cost increases in the future. See Part I  Item 1A. Risk Factors – “Our business is very dependent on the price and availability of aircraft fuel. Continued periods of high volatility in fuel costs  increased fuel prices or significant disruptions in the supply of aircraft fuel could have a significant negative impact on our operating results and liquidity.”  Seasonality and Other Factors  Due to the greater demand for air travel during the summer months  revenues in the airline industry in the second and third quarters of the year tend to be greater than revenues in the first and fourth quarters of the year. General economic conditions  fears of terrorism or war  fare initiatives  fluctuations in fuel prices  labor actions  weather  natural disasters  outbreaks of disease and other factors could impact this seasonal pattern. Therefore  our quarterly results of operations are not necessarily indicative of operating results for the entire year  and historical operating results in a quarterly or annual period are not necessarily indicative of future operating results.  Domestic and Global Regulatory Landscape  General  Airlines are subject to extensive domestic and international regulatory requirements. Domestically  the DOT and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) exercise significant regulatory authority over air carriers.  The DOT  among other things  oversees and regulates domestic and international codeshare agreements  international route authorities  competition and consumer protection matters such as advertising  denied boarding compensation and baggage liability. The Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (DOJ)  along with the DOT in certain instances  have jurisdiction over airline antitrust matters.  The FAA similarly exercises safety oversight and regulates most operational matters of our business  including how we operate and maintain our aircraft. FAA requirements cover  among other things  required technology and necessary onboard equipment; systems  procedures and training necessary to ensure the continuous airworthiness of our fleet of aircraft; safety measures and equipment; crew scheduling limitations and experience requirements; and many other technical aspects of airline operations. Additionally  our pilots and other employees are subject to rigorous certification standards  and our pilots and other crew members must adhere to flight time and rest requirements.   The FAA also controls the national airspace system  including operational rules and fees for air traffic control (ATC) services. The efficiency  reliability and capacity of the ATC network has a significant impact on our costs and on the timeliness of our operations.  The U.S. Postal Service has jurisdiction over certain aspects of the transportation of mail and related services.  Airport Access and Operations  Domestically  any U.S. airline authorized by the DOT is generally free to operate scheduled passenger service between any two points within the U.S. and its territories  with the exception of certain airports that require landing and take-off rights and authorizations (slots) and other facilities  and certain airports that impose geographic limitations on operations or curtail operations based on the time of day. Operations at three major domestic airports we serve (John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) and La Guardia Airport (LGA) in New York City  and Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA) in Washington  D.C.) and many foreign airports we serve (including LHR) are regulated by governmental entities through allocations of slots or similar regulatory mechanisms that limit the rights of carriers to conduct operations at those airports.   11  Each slot represents the authorization to land at or take off from the particular airport during a specified time period. In addition to slot restrictions  operations at LGA and DCA are also limited based on a so-called “perimeter rule” which generally limits the stage length of the flights that can be operated from those airports to 1 500 and 1 250 miles  respectively.  Our ability to provide service can also be impaired at airports  such as ORD and LAX where the airport gate and other facilities are currently inadequate to accommodate all of the service that we would like to provide  or airports such as Dallas Love Field Airport where we have no access to gates at all.  Existing law also permits domestic local airport authorities to implement procedures and impose restrictions designed to abate noise  provided such procedures and restrictions do not unreasonably interfere with interstate or foreign commerce or the national transportation system. In some instances  these restrictions have caused curtailments in service or increases in operating costs.  Airline Fares  Taxes and User Fees  Airlines are permitted to establish their own domestic fares without governmental regulation. The DOT maintains authority over certain international fares  rates and charges  but only applies this authority on a limited basis. In addition  international fares and rates are sometimes subject to the jurisdiction of the governments of the foreign countries which we serve.  Airlines are obligated to collect a federal excise tax  commonly referred to as the “ticket tax ” on domestic and international air transportation  and to collect other taxes and charge other fees  such as foreign taxes  security fees and passenger facility charges. Although these taxes and fees are not our operating expenses  they represent an additional cost to our customers. These taxes and fees are subject to increase from time to time.  DOT Passenger Protection Rules  The DOT regulates airline interactions with passengers through the ticketing process  at the airport and on board the aircraft. Among other things  these regulations govern how our fares are displayed online  required customer disclosures  access by disabled passengers  handling of long onboard flight delays and reporting of mishandled bags. In 2020  the DOT is expected to implement a number of new regulations that will impact us  including disability rules for accessible lavatories and refunds for checked bag fees in the event of certain delays in delivery.  International  International air transportation is subject to extensive government regulation  including aviation agreements between the U.S. and other countries or governmental authorities  such as the EU. Moreover  our alliances with international carriers may be subject to the jurisdiction and regulations of various foreign agencies. The U.S. government has negotiated “open skies” agreements with many countries  which allow unrestricted route authority access between the U.S. and the foreign markets. While the U.S. has worked to increase the number of countries with which open skies agreements are in effect  a number of markets important to us  including China  do not have open skies agreements.  In addition  foreign countries impose passenger protection rules  which are analogous to  and often meet or exceed the requirements of  the DOT passenger protection rules discussed above. In cases where these foreign requirements exceed the DOT rules  we may bear additional burdens and liabilities. Further  various foreign airport authorities impose noise restrictions at their local airports.  Security  Since shortly after the events of September 11  2001  substantially all aspects of civil aviation security in the U.S. or affecting U.S. carriers have been controlled or regulated by the federal government through the Transportation Security Administration (TSA). Requirements include flight deck security; carriage of federal air marshals at no charge; enhanced security screening of passengers  baggage  cargo  mail  employees and vendors; fingerprint-based background checks of all employees and vendor employees with access to secure areas of airports; and the provision of certain passenger data to the federal government and other international border security authorities  for security and immigration controls. Funding for the TSA is provided by a combination of air carrier fees  passenger fees and taxpayer funds. Customs and Border Protection  which  like the TSA  is part of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)  also promulgates requirements  performs services and collects fees that impact our provision of services. Additionally  we have at times found it necessary or desirable to make significant expenditures to comply with security-related requirements while seeking to reduce their impact on our customers  such as expenditures for automated security screening lines at airports. Our international service further requires us to comply with the civil aviation security regimes imposed at the foreign airports we serve.   12  Environmental Matters  Environmental Regulation  The airline industry is subject to various laws and government regulations concerning environmental matters in the U.S. and other countries. U.S. federal laws that have a particular impact on our operations include the Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990  the Clean Air Act  the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act  the Clean Water Act  the Safe Drinking Water Act and the Comprehensive Environmental Response  Compensation and Liability Act (Superfund Act). The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and other federal agencies have been authorized to promulgate regulations that have an impact on our operations. In addition to these federal activities  various states have been delegated certain authorities under the aforementioned federal statutes. Many state and local governments have adopted environmental laws and regulations which are similar to or stricter than federal requirements.  Revised underground storage tank regulations issued by the EPA in 2015 have affected certain airport fuel hydrant systems  with modifications of such systems needed in order to comply with applicable portions of the revised regulations. In addition  related to the EPA and state regulations pertaining to storm water management  several U.S. airport authorities are actively engaged in efforts to limit discharges of deicing fluid into the environment  often by requiring airlines to participate in the building or reconfiguring of airport deicing facilities.  The environmental laws to which we are subject include those related to responsibility for potential soil and groundwater contamination. We are conducting investigation and remediation activities to address soil and groundwater conditions at several sites  including airports and maintenance bases. We presently anticipate that the ongoing costs of such activities will not have a material impact on our operations. In addition  we have been named as a potentially responsible party (PRP) at certain Superfund sites. Our alleged volumetric contributions at such sites are relatively small in comparison to total contributions of all PRPs. Accordingly  we presently anticipate that any future payments of costs at such sites will not have a material impact on our operations.  We employ an environmental management system that provides a systematic approach for compliance with environmental regulations and management of a broad range of issues including air emissions  hazardous waste disposal  underground tanks  and aircraft water quality.   Aircraft Emissions and Climate Change Requirements  Many aspects of our operations are subject to a number of increasingly stringent environmental regulations and concerns about climate change and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions  including carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. In particular  the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) is in the process of adopting rules that will require us to limit the CO2 emissions of a significant majority of our international flights to a baseline level equal to our 2019-2020 average emissions from such flights. In 2016  ICAO passed a resolution adopting the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA)  an international  market-based emissions offset program intended to achieve carbon-neutral growth in the international aviation sector after 2020. CORSIA is expected to be implemented in three phases: the Pilot Phase (from 2021 to 2023); the First Phase (from 2024 to 2027); and the Second Phase (from 2027 to 2035). American and the majority of other U.S. airlines currently report their CO2 emissions to the FAA in accordance with CORSIA requirements. It is expected that the FAA (with the support of Congress) will implement regulations to establish a carbon offset credit surrender mechanism and to provide for the oversight and compliance auditing of the CORSIA obligations of U.S. carriers  including American.  To meet their obligations under CORSIA  airlines will have the option to increase the efficiency of their fleet  use sustainable or lower carbon aircraft fuel  or purchase carbon offset credits. At this time  the costs of complying with our future obligations under CORSIA are uncertain and cannot be fully predicted. For example  we will not directly control our CORSIA compliance costs during the CORSIA Pilot and First Phases because such phases include a sharing mechanism for the growth in emissions for the global aviation sector. In addition  and with respect to all phases of CORSIA including after 2027  there is uncertainty with respect to the future supply  demand and price of sustainable or lower carbon aircraft fuel  carbon offset credits and technologies that could allow airlines to reduce their emissions of CO2.  13  In the event that CORSIA does not come into force as expected  American and other airlines could become subject to an unpredictable and inconsistent array of national or regional emissions restrictions  creating a patchwork of complex regulatory requirements that will often affect global competitors differently and frequently offer no meaningful aviation environmental improvements. For example  a directive adopted in 2008 by the EU currently covers CO2 emissions from flights operating within the mostly European countries participating in the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS). The EU ETS does not apply to CO2 emissions from the vast majority of American flights serving EU countries because  in 2012  the EU agreed to suspend the application of its rules to international flights to pursue  instead  a global effort solely through ICAO. The EU has extended the suspension of its rules to international flights through the end of 2023  contingent on the successful implementation of CORSIA.   We have taken a number of actions that mitigate our GHG emissions and conserve fuel such as:  •retiring older  less fuel-efficient aircraft and replacing them with new  more fuel-efficient aircraft  resulting in the youngest mainline fleet of any U.S. network carrier;  •reducing fuel consumption through operational initiatives such as single-engine taxi and engine washing;  •working with the FAA and vendors to facilitate efficient airspace procedures  which also reduces aircraft emissions;  •updating our fleet with lightweight interiors including seats and furnishings and replacing existing cargo containers with lighter weight versions;   •replacing older  inefficient ground support equipment with new  more fuel-efficient ground support equipment  including alternative-fuel and electric powered equipment;  •purchasing renewable electricity to reduce indirect emissions associated with the production of the power we consume;  •seeking certification of certain of our buildings to the U.S. Green Building Council’s Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) standard;  •entering into discussions with potential vendors to explore potential production pathways for sustainable alternative aircraft fuel; and  •collaborating with airports and other stakeholders to accelerate the introduction of sustainable or lower carbon fuels.
